\section{HiggsCombine}

To run the fits and produce the impact plots, we have scripts modified from HIG-24-017 that simplify things greatly for us. Make sure you are in your \verb|Fit| workspace. There is a special repository/library that is needed for this:

\begin{verbatim}
    cd Fit
    git clone https://github.com/andrzejnovak/combine_postfits.git
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Once the repository is cloned, you need to set up the environment to use it:

\begin{verbatim}
    cd combine_postfits
    curl https://pyenv.run | bash 
    export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
    eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
    eval "$(pyenv init -)"
    eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
    exec "$SHELL"
    pyenv local 3.11.8
    pip3 install -e .
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Once the scripts are set up, you should be able to run the following scripts:

\begin{verbatim}
    python3 prepareHist.py
    python3 prepareFit.py
    python3 runLimit.py
    python3 runImpactFitDiag.py
    chmod +x makePrePostFitPlot.sh
    ./makePrePostFitPlot.sh
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Make sure for \verb|prepareHist.py| to go into the script and modify the channel (around Line 163). We need to run it for both ZccHcc and VHcc before moving onto running \verb|prepareFit.py|. To modify the plots for blinding the data in the signal region, there are modifications around Line 378 in \verb|prepareFit.py| that can be uncommented/swapped out to do this. To have the final plots use data and not MC, go into \verb|makePrePostFitPlot.sh| and uncomment the line about data (which just switches the flag from \verb|--MC| to \verb|--data|).

Also, make sure that you update the \verb|init.py| used by the \verb|pyenv|. We need to make sure to include some methods that aren't getting called in the older version that we do need when we modify the script. In your local directory:

\begin{verbatim}
    /uscms/home/[user]/.pyenv/versions/3.11.8/lib/python3.11/site-packages/mplhep/init.py
\end{verbatim}

\noindent where \verb|[user]| is your username. You must change the following line:

\begin{verbatim}
    from . import alice, atlas, cms, label, lhcb, plot
\end{verbatim}

\noindent into this:

\begin{verbatim}
    from . import alice, atlas, cms, label, lhcb, plot, error_estimation
\end{verbatim}
