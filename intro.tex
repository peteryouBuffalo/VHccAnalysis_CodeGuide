\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:intro}

So you want to get involved in the VqqHcc analysis at CMS started by D. Nguyen and P. Young? Well, you've come to the right place. This documentation is a great working guide for how to get started and what needs to be done. Follow this guide and you should be able to run the code yourself.

\section{Resources}
There are many resources you will want to keep track of including documentation with CMS, CERN, and this analysis. All of these types of documents and their links can be found in the bibliography at the end of this guide. We will reference them frequently, so it's a good idea to bookmark them on your browser.

In terms of browsers, I use Google Chrome. However, any browser should work for you since you don't need to be connected to your grid certificate through a browser for this (typically done with Firefox)~\cite{cms_getting_started}.
